### GET /vegetables?name=[partial-query]

_Note: This is not a new route!_

* e.g. `GET http://localhost:5000/vegetables?name="pepper"`

> Return a list of all vegetables where the query is included somewhere in the name.

**Correct Response Body Example**
```json
[
  { "id": "AEdvQm9t_", "name": "green pepper", "price": "0.99" },
  { "id": "JA_dIbXLW", "name": "red pepper", "price": "0.99" }
]
```

> If there are no vegetables that match, just return an empty array.

**Correct Response Body Example**
```json
[]
```

### DELETE /vegetables/[id]

* e.g. `DELETE http://localhost:5000/vegetables/5TsEt-xfI`

> If there is a record where the ID matches, remove the resource from the array. Return a status code of *200*.

**Correct Response Body Example**
```json
{ "id": "5TsEt-xfI", "name": "turnip", "price": "0.79" }
```

> If there is not a record where the ID matches, return an error with a status of `404` saying that the vegetable could not be found.

**Incorrect Response Body Example**
```json
{ "message": "Could not find vegetable with ID of 1" }
```

### PUT /vegetables/[id]

* e.g. `PUT http://localhost:5000/vegetables/5TsEt-xfI`

> If there is a record where the ID matches, validate the request body and then update the resource with the new information. Return a status code of *200*.

**Correct Request Body Example**
```json
{ "name": "turnip", "price": "0.79" }
```

**Correct Response Body Example**
```json
